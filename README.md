# Twitter_Followers
I have connected to Twitter's streaming API since September 1st, 2013.  I am downloading tweets with GPS coordinates.

Curious as to the distribution of users, I have randomly sampled these data and uploaded summary statistics here.  Per Twitter's developer agreement, I cannot share the tweets themselves.
